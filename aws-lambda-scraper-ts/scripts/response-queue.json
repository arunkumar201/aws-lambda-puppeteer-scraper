After years of wrestling with project management tools that never quite fit my needs, I reached my breaking point. The tools were either too complex, too rigid, or missing critical features that my teams needed. So I did what any frustrated developer would do – I built my own.\n\n\n## Markdown Simplicity in a WYSIWYG World\n\nMost project management tools force you into their proprietary editors with fancy formatting options that ultimately create more problems than they solve. All I wanted was to edit markdown files – simple, portable, version-control friendly text that everyone already understands. Why should documenting a story be more complicated than writing code?\n\nMy solution: a project management system where everything is markdown at its core. Stories, documentation, comments – all just markdown files that can be edited with any text editor or through a clean interface that doesn't get in your way.\n\n\n## Beyond the Tyranny of Story Points\n\nThe industry's obsession with story points as the one true estimation metric has always felt limiting. Development work is multidimensional, so why shouldn't our estimates reflect that?\n\nI implemented a relative weight system with four key metrics:\n\nValue: What benefit does this bring to users/business?\n\nPenalty: What's the cost of not doing this work?\n\nEffort: How much work is required?\n\nRisk: How uncertain or complex is the implementation?\n\n• Value: What benefit does this bring to users/business?\n\n• Penalty: What's the cost of not doing this work?\n\n• Effort: How much work is required?\n\n• Risk: How uncertain or complex is the implementation?\n\nThis approach gives teams a more nuanced way to prioritize work and makes trade-offs explicit rather than hidden.\n\n\n## Documentation as First-Class Citizens\n\nIn most tools, Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and Post-Mortems are afterthoughts – if they exist at all. They're typically buried in wikis or shared drives, disconnected from the work they relate to.\n\nI built a system where ADRs and Post-Mortems are just as important as stories. They're versioned, linked to related work items, and follow the same workflow processes. This creates a connected knowledge base that evolves with your project, not separate from it.\n\n\n## Closing the Feedback Loop\n\nOne of my biggest frustrations was the lack of feedback from production systems. We'd deploy features and then... silence. The project management tool had no idea what happened next.\n\nMy solution aims to integrate deployment data and production metrics directly into the workflow. When a story is deployed, we automatically track:\n\nDeployment frequency\nLead time for changes\nMean time to restore service\nChange failure rate\n\n• Deployment frequency\n\n• Lead time for changes\n\n• Mean time to restore service\n\n• Change failure rate\n\nThese DORA metrics provide immediate feedback on how our development practices are working, creating a cycle of feedback.\n\n\n## Kanban That Actually Measures\n\nMost Kanban implementations are just pretty boards with columns. They lack the metrics that make Kanban powerful: cycle time, throughput, and work in progress limits.\n\nI built Kanban metrics into the core of the system, automatically tracking how work flows through the process and highlighting bottlenecks. The board isn't just a visualization – it's a data collection tool that helps teams continuously improve.\n\n\n## The Power of Large Context Windows\n\nBuilding this system became much more feasible with the advent of large context window AI models. I could feed in CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, and entire codebases to generate comprehensive documentation, user stories, and even implementation plans.\n\nThis dramatically accelerated development and ensured consistency across the entire system. The AI could understand the relationships between different components and help generate coherent documentation that reflected those connections.\n\nHaving everything structured and a application that lends it self well to 'tool usage' - this could be a starting point for a lot of help. However - I don't want to cheap out and get a bunch of things ironed out before integrating some 3rd party agentic api.\n\n\n## Personal Tools for Personal Workflows\n\nWhat makes this project special is that I'm building it primarily for myself. I'm not trying to please every user or cater to enterprise requirements – I'm solving my own problems in exactly the way I want them solved. This freedom has allowed me to experiment with approaches that commercial tools would never consider.\n\nWhat started as a frustration-fueled side project has the potential to become my personal competitive advantage. I move faster, make better decisions, and have a complete history of why I built what I built – all while creating an environment where AI agents can provide increasingly valuable assistance.\n\nSometimes the best solution isn't finding the perfect tool – it's building exactly what you need. And sometimes, a little anger is all the motivation required.\n\nWhat's a billboard?\n          \n        \n      \n        \n          \n    \n\n\n          Manage preferences\n        \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          \n    \n\n\n          Report billboard\n\n• What's a billboard?\n\n• Manage preferences\n\n• Report billboard\n\n\n## Built for developers, by developers.\n\nWhether you're building a simple prototype or a business-critical product, Heroku's fully-managed platform gives you the simplest path to delivering apps quickly — using the tools and languages you already love!\n\nLearn More\n\n\n## Top comments (38)\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nLocation\n          \n          \n            Heredia, Costa Rica\n          \n        \n          \n            \n              Work\n            \n            \n              Senior software developer @ Intel\n            \n          \n      \n        \n          Joined\n        \n        \n          Sep 5, 2022\n\n• Location\n          \n          \n            Heredia, Costa Rica\n\n• Work\n            \n            \n              Senior software developer @ Intel\n\n• Joined\n        \n        \n          Sep 5, 2022\n\nCopy link\n        \n          \n              \n                Hide\n              \n          \n        \n        Report abuse\n\n• Copy link\n\n• Hide\n\n• Report abuse\n\nYou got my interest, but I see no URL for things.

And I guess the code needs a bit more checking before I could OS it. I am more in a experimentation phase and I do not want to go down the typical buzz/audience/product route for an itch that probably only I have to scratch.\n\nIf you want to take one thing away: a wiki in your codebase and a 'agentic LLM' is a good thing for backlog work. Another thing would be building on google sheets/docs and gemini. but I havent tried that.\n\nJoined\n        \n        \n          Feb 24, 2024\n\n• Joined\n        \n        \n          Feb 24, 2024\n\nCopy link\n        \n          \n              \n                Hide\n              \n          \n        \n        Report abuse\n\n• Copy link\n\n• Hide\n\n• Report abuse\n\nMy workflow is similar and I've had a lot of the same thoughts. Also, I'm working on a bunch of components that didn't exist to help me manage my workflow at large. It's a great idea and I'd be interested in contributing and getting it production grade.

How do you think we got things like graph databases, document databases, etc. because sometimes the status quo doesn't cut it when we are trying to move faster or innovate.\n\nI too would be interested in seeing your product in action like many have commented, but I also appreciate that this post was probably just a rant and hope you continue to reap the benefits from what you have developed.\n\nWhen the status quo becomes disruptive, disrupt the status quo.\n\nLocation\n          \n          \n            Hamburg, Germany\n          \n        \n          \n            \n              Pronouns\n            \n            \n              He/Him\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              Work\n            \n            \n              Principal Architect\n            \n          \n      \n        \n          Joined\n        \n        \n          May 28, 2017\n\n• Location\n          \n          \n            Hamburg, Germany\n\n• Pronouns\n            \n            \n              He/Him\n\n• Work\n            \n            \n              Principal Architect\n\n• Joined\n        \n        \n          May 28, 2017\n\nCopy link\n        \n          \n              \n                Hide\n              \n          \n        \n        Report abuse\n\n• Copy link\n\n• Hide\n\n• Report abuse\n\ni think  I will speak about the data model in a follow up post.
