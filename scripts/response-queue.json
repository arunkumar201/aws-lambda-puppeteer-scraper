      "markdown": "Next.js is a popular React framework that enables you to build modern web applications with a focus on performance and ease of development. It provides a set of features that make React development easier, such as:\nKey Features of Next.js:\n\n\nServer-Side Rendering (SSR):\nNext.js allows you to render your React components on the server side before sending the HTML to the browser. This can improve SEO and performance, as the page is fully rendered when it reaches the client.\n\n\nStatic Site Generation (SSG):\nIt can pre-render pages at build time, generating static HTML. This is great for sites where content doesn’t change frequently, as it can be served very quickly from a CDN.\n\n\nAPI Routes:\nNext.js allows you to define backend API routes alongside your frontend code. These API routes can act as serverless functions to handle requests like form submissions or database queries.\n\n\nFile-based Routing:\nThe routing system in Next.js is based on the file structure. This means you don’t need to manually define routes. Just create files and directories in the pages folder, and Next.js automatically creates routes for you.\n\n\nAutomatic Code Splitting:\nNext.js automatically splits your code to improve performance. It only loads the necessary JavaScript for the current page, which results in faster page loads.\n\n\nHot Reloading:\nNext.js comes with a development server that provides fast hot reloading, making it easy to see changes instantly during development.\n\n\nOptimized Images:\nIt includes an Image component that automatically optimizes and serves images in modern formats like WebP, making your website faster.\n\n\nInternationalization (i18n):\nNext.js offers built-in support for multiple languages, making it easier to create multilingual websites.\n\n\nBuilt-in CSS and Sass Support:\nYou can use CSS modules or global styles with Sass without needing additional configuration.\n\n\nWhy Use Next.js?\n\n\nSEO: The SSR and SSG capabilities make it great for SEO, as search engines can crawl fully rendered content easily.\n\n\nPerformance: Features like code splitting, image optimization, and automatic static generation help create faster web apps.\n\n\nDeveloper Experience: The framework provides great tooling, a smooth dev environment, and a strong community.\n\n\nFlexibility: You can mix and match SSR, SSG, and client-side rendering based on the requirements of each page.\n\n\nUse Cases for Next.js:\n\n\nBlogs, static websites (using SSG)\n\n\nE-commerce websites (using SSR and SSG for dynamic pages)\n\n\nDashboards and admin panels (using API routes)\n\n\nLarge-scale web applications (thanks to its flexibility and performance features)\n\n\nOverall, Next.js simplifies many of the complexities involved in building performant, SEO-friendly React applications.",

      "markdown": "Investor sentiment in India is influenced by a combination of domestic and global factors, reflecting the broader economic and market environment. Here are some of the key factors currently shaping investor sentiment in India:\n1. Macroeconomic Conditions\n\n\nGDP Growth and Economic Outlook: The health of India’s economy plays a significant role. Investors keep an eye on quarterly GDP growth, inflation rates, and forecasts by institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\n\nInflation and Interest Rates: The RBI’s monetary policy, including any rate hikes or cuts, has a direct impact on the cost of borrowing and consumer spending. Rising inflation can hurt consumer purchasing power and affect corporate earnings.\n\n\nEmployment Data: The unemployment rate, especially in the wake of the pandemic, impacts consumer sentiment and discretionary spending, which in turn affects stock market performance.\n\n\n2. Government Policy and Reforms\n\n\nFiscal Policies: Any changes in tax policy, subsidies, or government spending on infrastructure projects can significantly affect investor sentiment. India’s push for manufacturing (e.g., the \"Make in India\" initiative) or rural economic policies are also key factors.\n\n\nRegulatory Changes: Changes in regulations around sectors like banking, telecom, technology, and pharmaceuticals often shape investor behavior. For example, ease of doing business reforms or changes in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) can boost confidence.\n\n\nElection Results and Political Stability: Investors tend to respond positively to a stable political environment. On the other hand, uncertainty surrounding elections or political upheaval can lead to a more cautious outlook.\n\n\n3. Stock Market Performance\n\n\nBenchmark Indices (Nifty, Sensex): Investor sentiment is heavily driven by movements in these indices. A strong bull market tends to boost investor optimism, while a prolonged bear market can create fear.\n\n\nCorporate Earnings: The performance of large listed companies, particularly in sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, energy, and banking, influences sentiment. Healthy corporate earnings can lead to increased investor confidence.\n\n\nForeign Portfolio Investments (FPI): FPI inflows are a critical indicator of investor sentiment. Foreign investors closely watch India’s economic and political landscape, and large inflows or outflows can sway market trends.\n\n\n4. Global Economic Trends\n\n\nGlobal Market Conditions: India’s markets are often influenced by the performance of global indices such as the S&P 500 and emerging market indices. Economic slowdowns or crises in major economies (US, China, EU) can cause global risk aversion, which impacts Indian stocks.\n\n\nGeopolitical Risks: Regional tensions (such as those involving Pakistan or China) or global uncertainties (like the Russia-Ukraine w",
