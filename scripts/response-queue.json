This decline was broad-based, with all sectoral indices settling in the red, including Nifty Realty, Energy, Consumer Durables, Oil & Gas, Auto, PSU Bank, FMCG, Metal, and Financial Services, each down over 1%1245.\n\n\nMajor Sensex constituents such as Tata Motors, Titan, Eternal, Power Grid, Tata Steel, L&T, and Mahindra & Mahindra were among the top losers, falling over 2% each, while Bajaj Finserv, Asian Paints, and Tech Mahindra were among the few gainers4.\n\n\nThe market was influenced by the weekly expiry of Nifty 50 futures and options contracts and cautious global sentiment due to limited clarity in the partial U.S.-China trade deal, which leaves room for renewed tariff tensions. Additionally, escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and rising oil prices contributed to risk aversion among investors1234.\n\n\nAnalysts noted that consolidation in domestic markets is evolving into a broad-based trend affecting large-cap stocks, with valuation concerns and rising oil prices fueling investor caution. The U.S. is also considering unilateral tariff hikes on key trading partners, adding to uncertainty24.\n\n\nDespite the sharp fall, technical analysts suggest that the broader trend remains strong and a short-term reversal is possible, though a decisive break below 24,850 on the Nifty could weaken market sentiment further4.\n\n\nInstitutional investors continued their buying streak on the domestic front, while foreign portfolio investors ended their three-day buying spree3.\n\n\nIn the broader market, Nifty Midcap100 and Smallcap100 indices also closed lower by 1.73% and 1.90%, respectively4.\n\n\nNotably, Eris Lifesciences shares surged 11% during the day, marking a rare bright spot in an otherwise weak market4.\n\n• The BSE Sensex fell sharply by 823.16 points (1.00%) to close at 81,691.98, and the NSE Nifty dropped 253.20 points (1.01%) to finish at 24,888.20.

The Indian government held all-party meetings to brief leaders and build political consensus supporting the operation. Measures such as school closures in Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir, blackout orders in border districts, and increased security at airports and border outposts were implemented amid the escalating conflict.
